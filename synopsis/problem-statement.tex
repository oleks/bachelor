\section{Problem statement}

What are some of the presently known methods of performing termination 
analysis? Can they be applied to higher-order programs? Are they fully 
automatic, i.e.  do not require human intervention?  Are they sound?  Are they 
complete? What are the limitations of these methods and are they efficient?

The preliminary focus is on the size-change termination principle, which states 
that a program terminates if every infinite control flow sequence infinitely 
descends a well-founded data value, that is, a data value that bottoms 
out\cite{size-change}.
