\section{Documentation}

It is expected that project documentation in the form of a report is handed in 
by noon, January $10^{th}$ 2012.

Documentation is expected to be written in lockstep with the various tasks 
outlined above, and therefore demands no task in and of itself. For example, 
given the theoretic nature of the project a substantial amount of ``reporting'' 
is expected for the step where the key concepts are to be described in terms of 
the devised language.
