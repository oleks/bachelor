\chapter{Definitions}

\begin{description}

\item [Primitive recursion] Recursive functions who have at least one element
decrease in value upon each iteration and all arguments bottom out, i.e. can't
be decreased further. At most when all arguments decrease to their base value
does the function terminate.

\end{description}

\subsection{Partial order}

A partial order is binary relation that is both reflexive, transitive and
associative. A partial order is e.g. the $\leq$ relation on natural numbers.

\subsection{String partial order}

An irreflexive and asymmetric partial order.

\subsection{A well-founded relatation}

A relation like the $<$ relation on natural numbers.



\subsection{Partially recursive}

Turing complete -- a language with unbounded loops

\subsection{Primitive recursive}

A language wich successor and predecessor operators as well as bounded loops.
Primitive recursive functions always halt.
