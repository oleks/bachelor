\chapter{On general unsolvability of the halting problem}

\section{Computation environment}

Finitely many different instructions

A procedure is a finite length sequence of instructions, i.e. a countable set
that can be enumerated.

Every instruction is discrete, as in there are no continuous processes.

Every instruction is concrete, as in there are no stochastic processes.

\section{Effectiveness}
