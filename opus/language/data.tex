\section{Data}

\D{} is a simple language where the emphasis is on the sizes of data. Hence,
the way that data values are constructed does not have to be particularly
practical, but all values have to be well founded and easily comparable.

The language \D{} is untyped, and represents all data in terms of
\emph{unlabeled ordered binary trees}, henceforth referred to as simply,
\emph{binary trees}. Such a tree is recursively defined as follows:

\begin{definition}

A binary tree is a set that is either empty, heneceforth refferred to as a leaf
or simply $0$, or contains a single unlabeled node with two binary trees as
it's left and right child, henceforth simply reffered to as a node. We'll refer
to the set of all possible values in \D{} as $\mathbb{B}$.

\end{definition}

To operate on such trees we'll require a few primitives. Namely, a
representation of leafs, recursive construction and destruction of nodes, as
well as a way to tell nodes and leafs apart. Most of these will be derived in
the operational semantics of \D{}\footnote{See \referToSection{d-sos}.},
however, they will make use of the following primitive function:

\begin{definition}

The function $\cdot :\mathbb{B}\times\mathbb{B}\rightarrow\mathbb{B}$
constructs a node with the two arguments as it's left and right child,
respectively. We'll refer to this function, as well as the operator $\cdot$ in
general, as ``cons''. 

\end{definition}
