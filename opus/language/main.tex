\chapter{The language \D{}}

For the purposes of describing size-change termination we'll consider a
language \D{}. The following chapter describes the syntax and semantics of the
language.

\section{General properties}

The intent of the language is for it be used to explain concepts such as
size-change termination. One of the fundamental concepts required of the
language of application is that it's datatypes are well-founded. That is, any
subset $S$ of the range of values of some well-defined type has a value $s$
s.t. $\forall {s'\in S}\ s\leq s'$. This makes it ideal to chose some
oversimplistic data type structure rather than an army of basic types. Besides,
an apropriately defined basic data type should be able to represent arbitrarily
complex data values.

The language is initially first-order since the size-change termination
principle is first described for first-order programs later on in this work.
However, the language is designed so that it is easy to turn it into a
high-level language without much effort. This may prove necessary as we try to
expand size-change termination to higher-order programs.

The language is a call-by-value and purely functional to avoid any problems
that could arise from regarding lazy programs or where the notion of a global
state of the machine is relevant. Simply put, this is done to ensure elegance
of further proof with the help of the language.
