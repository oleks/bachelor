\chapter{Shape-Change Termination}

One trouble with size-change termination as described in the previous chapter
is \referToLemma{cycle-reduce}. This lemma makes size-change termination weak
in the sense that the overall shape changes in a given call cycle are
\emph{not} considered, and instead, the calls of any call cycle are constrained
to nonincreasing calls. However, there may be programs that have calls, or even
call cycles, that in terms of size, increase a value for a finite amount of
time, until some condition is met, or as in the case of \D{}, it has some
particular shape.

Consider the program in \referToListing{size-change-fail} as an example of a
program for which regular size-change termination is unable to determine the
halting property, while the property itself would seem fairly simple to deduce.
This is a sample program where some value is increased in terms of size in a
call cycle, but only until the value matches a certain shape, the shape
required by a terminal clause.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  label=listing:size-change-fail,
  caption={A terminating program with a call cycle where a value is
  temporarily increased.}]
$f_0$: f a.b.c.d := a
$f_1$: f a := f a.0
f input
\end{lstlisting}

The extension proposed in this chapter is to be able to determine the halting
property for such a class of programs without reducing size of the class of
programs for which size-change termination can already deduce the halting
property.

In the discussion below we disregard the definitions of unary recursive call
graphs and no longer assume to only have programs where at most one variable is
bound in every clause. Moreover, we still let all the clauses be unary due to
\referToTheorem{mutlivariate-to-unary}. 

\section{The class of programs considered}

Before we can speak of extending size-change termination to determine the
halting property for programs in the same class as
\referToListing{size-change-fail}, we need to formally define that class.

Actual conditions in \D{} can only be expressed in terms of patterns in
function clauses. Hence, we disregard programs that rely on equality or size
comparison conditions for termination, since this type of programs will often
already be covered by regular size-change termination, and if not, they at the
very least come down to recursive pattern matching.

As an example of a program where size-change termination is already prevalent,
consider a program that finds the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number as the one already
presented in \referToSection{d-samples}. The function \mono{fibonacci-aux}
seemingly increases a value until a condition is met, in particular, until we
count one of the arguments down to \mono{0}. However, due to the fact that we
count that we decrease the value of that argument in \emph{recursive} clause of
the \mono{fibonacci-aux} functions, the halting property is certainly already
deducible by regular size-change termination.

Instead, we turn our attention to simpler programs, ones that rely solely on
conditions defined in terms of patterns. Consider again the program in
\referToListing{size-change-fail}. The function \mono{f} has only one terminal
clause, the one that accepts a shape as in \referToFigure{size-change-fail-f0}.
If the function argument has any other shape, i.e. either a shape as in
\referToFigure{size-change-fail-f1-0}, \referToFigure{size-change-fail-f1-1} or
\referToFigure{size-change-fail-f1-2}, then the recursive clause $f_1$ is
chosen. For any argument $b\in\mathbb{B}$, the clause $f_1$ replaces the
right-most child of the value, which is always \mono{0}, with a node.

For instance, the smallest possible argument $b\in\mathbb{B}$ is \mono{0}.  If
passed such a value, $f_1$ transforms it into a value that has a shape that
corresponds to \referToFigure{size-change-fail-f1-1}, which in turn transforms
the value into one that matches \referToFigure{size-change-fail-f1-2}, which in
turn transforms the value into one that matches
\referToFigure{size-change-fail-f0}, i.e. the terminal clause. What's more,
there are infinitely many other values that will match the shape
\referToFigure{size-change-fail-f1-1}, and for each of them, the clause $f_1$
will transform them into values that match
\referToFigure{size-change-fail-f1-2}, which will transform them into values
that match \referToFigure{size-change-fail-f0}.

\referToListing{size-change-fail} will accept.}

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

We shall henceforth say that a clause such as $f_1$ changes the shape of any
argument $b$ to \emph{eventually} match the shape corresponding to a pattern of
the terminal clause $f_0$. The task then becomes to determine for each call
cycle in a program whether it changes the shape of the argument to eventually
match some terminal clause.

\section{Preliminaries}

Before we continue with this extension we can make a few important observations
based on the semantics of function clauses in \D{}.

\subsection{Deducing leafs}\label{section:extend-deducing-zero}

The \mono{.} operator in the patterns of function clauses in \D{} is
right-associative. Hence, a pattern of the form \mono{a.b.c.d} is the same as
\mono{a.(b.(c.d))}. This implies that we can always construct a parenthesized
version of any valid pattern, indeed this is required to keep the syntax
unambiguous. This associativity can be overridden by the conventional use of
parentheses, e.g. a pattern like \mono{(a.b).c.d} is the same as
\mono{(a.b).(c.d)}. 

Consider the function defined in \referToListing{deducing-zero}. If $f_0$ and
$f_1$ both fail to accept some argument $b\in\mathbb{B}$, then $b$ must match
the pattern $0\cdot b'$, where $b'\geq 0$, that is, on entry to $f_2$, \mono{d}
is \emph{always} bound to \mono{0}, and \mono{e} is always bound to some
$b'\geq 0$.

\begin{proof} Otherwise, either $f_0$ or $f_1$ would've matched. \end{proof}

\begin{lstlisting}[label=listing:deducing-zero,
  caption={A sample program for showing 0-deduction.}]
$f_0$: f 0 := 0
$f_1$: f (a.b).c := 0
$f_2$: f d.e := 0
\end{lstlisting}

Such a deduction is not always unambiguous as the function in
\referToListing{deducing-zero-fail} exhibits. Here, if $g_0$ and $g_1$ both
fail to accept some argument $b\in\mathbb{B}$, then the shape of $b$ is either
$0\cdot b'$ or $b'\cdot 0$ where $b\geq 0$. However, one thing is certain, and
that is that $b$ can't have the shape $b'\cdot b''$ where $b'>0$ and $b''>0$.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=listing:deducing-zero-fail,
  caption={A sample program where 0-deduction is ambiguous.}]
$g_0$: g 0 := 0
$g_1$: g (a.b).(c.d) := 0
$g_2$: g e.f := 0
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Disjoint shapes}

\begin{definition} Given two shapes, $s_1,s_2\in\mathbb{S}$, we say that $s_1$
and $s_2$ are disjoint, or $s_1\cap s_2=\emptyset$, iff given $B_1=\{b\mid
b\in\mathbb{B} \wedge b\succ s_1\}$ and $B_2=\{b\mid b\in\mathbb{B} \wedge
b\succ s_2\}$ it holds that $B_1\cap B_2=\emptyset$.\end{definition}

\begin{definition} Given a shape $s\in\mathbb{S}$, let $S^d_s= \left\{s^d \mid
s^d\in\mathbb{S} \wedge s\cap s^d=\emptyset \wedge \forall\ s^d_1\in
S^d_s\backslash\{s^d\}\ s^d\cap s^d_1=\emptyset \right\}$ be the set of shapes
disjoint with $s$ and with each other.\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{lemma:extend-finite-converse} Given a shape
$s\in\mathbb{S}$, the set $S^d_s$, is finite.\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} The proof is two-fold,

\begin{enumerate}

\item Given a shape $s\in\mathbb{S}$, there is a shape $s'\in\mathbb{S}$ for
every leaf and every node in $s$ s.t. $s\cap s'=\emptyset$. In particular, for
every leaf in $s$, there is a shape $s'$, that is otherwise equal to $s$, but
in place of the particular leaf in $s$, it has a node with two triangles as
children.  Likewise, for every node in $s$, there is a shape $s'$, that is
otherwise equal to $s$, but in place of the particular node in $s$, there is a
leaf. Any other shapes wouldn't be disjoint with either $s$ or the shapes
already considered. It is easy to see that all such $s'\in\mathbb{S}$ are also
pairwise disjoint.

\item For any given shape $s\in\mathbb{S}$ the number of nodes and leafs is
finite by \referToDefinition{shape}.\end{enumerate}\end{proof} 

\begin{definition} Given a pairwise disjoint set of shapes $S_1$, and another
pairwise disjoint set of shapes $S_2$, let $$S_1\Cup S_2 = \left\{ s \left|
\begin{array}{ll} &\left(s\in S_1 \wedge \left(\exists\ s'\in S_2\ s\cap
s'\neq\emptyset \longrightarrow s\succ s' \right) \right)\\ \vee & \left( s\in
S_2 \wedge \left(\exists\ s'\in S_1\ s\cap s'\neq\emptyset \longrightarrow
s\succ s' \right) \right) \end{array} \right.\right\}.$$\end{definition}

In particular, the set $S_1\Cup S_2$ is the union of the two sets where for any
pair of patterns that match one another, the one with the most nodes and leafs
is chosen. 

\subsection{Plausible shapes}

\begin{definition} We say that a variable $v\in\mathbb{V}$ with some value
$b\in\mathbb{B}$ has a set of plausible shapes $S_v$ iff $\exists\ s\in S_v\
b\succ s \wedge \left( \forall\ s'\in S_v\backslash\{s\}\ b \not{\succ} s'
\right)$.\end{definition}

\begin{corollary} By \referToDefinition{succ}, given a variable
$v\in\mathbb{V}$ with some unknown value $b\in\mathbb{B}$, the set of plausible
shapes $S_v=\{\any\}$.\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary} Given a clause $\left\langle v,p,x
\right\rangle\in\mathbb{C}$, and a value $b\in\mathbb{B}$, if $b\succ p$, then
$S=\{p\}$\footnote{Patterns are shapes as
\referToDefinition{pattern-is-shape}.}.\end{corollary}

%$$C = \left\langle v_1,p_1, x_1 \right\rangle, \left\langle v_2, p_2, x_2
%\right\rangle, \ldots, \left\langle v_{|C|}, p_{|C|}, x_{|C} \right\rangle.$$

Consider henceforth a function call $f = \left\langle v, C \right\rangle$.
Given a tuple $\left\langle i,j \right\rangle$ from the set $\left\{
\left\langle i, j \right\rangle \mid 0 < i < |C| \wedge j = i + 1 \right\}$,
consider also the clauses $c_i = \left\langle v_i, p_i, x_i \right\rangle, c_j
= \left\langle v_j, p_j, x_j \right\rangle \in C$. Let $B_i=\{b\mid
b\in\mathbb{B} \wedge b \succ p_i\}$ and $B_j=\{b\mid b\in\mathbb{B} \wedge b
\succ p_j\}$ denote the sets of values that the clauses $c_i$ and $c_j$ accept,
respectively.

\begin{corollary}\label{corollary:nice-1} Given the semantics of \D{}, i.e.
that clause $c_i$ will be considered before $c_j$, we can deduce that if $c_j$
indeed accepts a given value $b\in\mathbb{B}$, that $c_i$ hence rejected, the
set of plausible values for $b$ must be $B_j-B_i$.\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}\label{corollary:nice-2} Given a set $S^d_i$ of clauses
disjoint with the shape corresponding to pattern $p_i$, let $S_c'=S^d_i\Cup
p_j$ and $S_c=S_c'-\left\{ s \left| s\in S'_c \wedge s\not{\succ} p_j
\right.\right\}$. Due to \referToCorollary{nice-1}, the clause $c_j$ could've
been expressed in terms of the list of the following list of clauses:  

$$C_j = \left\langle v_j,p_1, x_j \right\rangle, \left\langle v_j, p_2, x_j
\right\rangle, \ldots, \left\langle v_j, p_n, x_j \right\rangle,$$

where and $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n\subset S_c$ and $n=|S_c|$.\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem} A function $f = \left\langle v, C \right\rangle$ can be defined
in such a way that $B_i\cap B_j=\emptyset$.\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Follows from the semantics of \D{},
\referToDefinition{exhaustive} and \referToCorollary{nice-2}. \end{proof}

Given that all clauses are unary and patterns correspond to shapes, we
henceforth say that clauses, like the shapes that their patterns represent can
be ``disjoint''.

\begin{definition} Given the clauses $c_1 = \left\langle \_, p_1, \_
\right\rangle, c_2 = \left\langle \_, p_2, \_ \right\rangle\in \mathbb{C} $, we
say $c_1\cap c_2 = \emptyset$ iff $p_1\cap p_2 = \emptyset$.\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{definition:nice-3} All programs henceforth considered
have function definitions with clause lists $C=c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n$ s.t.
$\forall\ \left\langle i,j \right\rangle \in \left\{ \left\langle i, j
\right\rangle \mid 0 < i < n \wedge i < j \leq n \right\}\ c_i \cap c_j =
\emptyset $.\end{definition}

\section{Shape-change termination}

In the next section we consider recursive call graphs as defined in
\referToSection{size-change-termination} albeit for programs as discussed in
\referToDefinition{nice-3}.

\section{Termination \& Soundness}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:extend-function-finite-shape} Any function
declaration accepts a finite number of shapes for every parameter.\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Any function in \D{} consists of a finite number of clauses and
by \referToLemma{extend-clause-finite}, every clause accepts a finite number of
shapes for every parameter.\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:extend-any-function-any-value} Any function accepts
any valid \D{} value as any parameter.\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Follows from the semantics of \D{}.\end{proof}

\begin{definition} A shape transition source and target are different from a
function call source and target in that a function function may elicit one of
several shape transitions.\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:extend-any-call-targets} Any possible function call in a program has at least one and at
most all of the shapes of a target function as its shape transition
targets.\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} By \referToLemma{extend-any-function-any-value} any value is
matched by at least one of the shapes of a given function. Any value matches
the triangle shape, and by \referToTheorem{d-all-patterns-all-shapes}, the
patterns for a particular parameter in summation can match any value, i.e. in
total correspond to the triangle shape.\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} A shape shift network can be constructed for any valid program
in finite time.\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Any given program has a finite number of functions. By
\referToLemma{extend-function-finite-shape} the program may hence initially be
considered as finite forest of shapes. Furthermore, by
\referToLemma{extend-any-call-targets} any pair of shapes can be directly
connected by at most one directed edge. Hence, the said forest has a finite
number of edges. The algorithm is sound if all the edges possibly taken by an
executing program are in place when it terminates.  Hence, if we terminate the
branches of the algorithm whenever they reach a terminal clause or enclose a
loop, eventually the algorithm must terminate.\end{proof}


When a function call is made, a list of expressions, each consisting of nested
constructions of concrete values, bound variables and nested function calls, is
evaluated. For each such call, for each expression in the argument list, we
would like a relationship to be drawn between the target input arguments (for
which we already have some shape information) 


\includeFigure{size-change-fail-shape-done}{Nice}



If there is a cycle where we start from one of the disjoint shapes and come
back to that shape, then the change must've occurred in one of the triangles.
If the value was not decreased (size change termination), then the value
must've been increased, or remained unchanged, and this is an infinite loop.


\begin{proof} Otherwise, there wouldn't have been a loop. This is because the
shapes are disjoint, so a change in a triangle can by no means make the value
match another shape, otherwise the shapes indeed are \emph{not} disjoint.
\end{proof}





\newpage

\section{Notes}

Size change termination is indeed an abstraction of what we would like to do.
Given that $p_0\curlyvee p_1$, we know that if any 


A program can be rewritten into a single function where an extra parameter is
added to each function, to distinguish the functions and each function gets a
number of auxiliary parameters which are ignored in general. This way, a
program of various functions can be transformed into a program consisting of a
single function with many clauses, subsets of which represent the individual
functions of the original program.

The problem is thus reduced to checking the halting property for some single
arbitrary function.

Any function has a number of clauses, at least one. Any terminating program has
at least one terminal clause. The point of checking the halting property is
hence to deduce that any possible recursive clause that is taken, alters the
shape of its arguments in such a way that the call cycle eventually reduces the
value towards one, or several of the base cases.

The benefit of this method over original size change termination is that it
allows for some control transitions to increase values, as long as the overall
cycle size and shape mutation goes towards a some base case.

As much information about the shape of the (changing) value has to be withkept
across calls, unlike original size-change termination that allows to discard
shape information from the previous clause.

Next, we make the observation that several functions may participate in a call
cycle.  and in particular, a subset of the recursive clauses may participate in
a call cycle. The call cycle describes a terminating loop if every control
transition is nonincreasing and at least one is increasing, or the loop shape
shifts one of the values towards a base of one of the participating functions.

\subsection{Recursive and terminal clauses}

\begin{lemma}
A program terminates if all the functions terminate.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Assume for the sake of contradiction that this is does not hold.
That would imply that one of \D{}'s primitives does not terminate, which is
absurd.  \end{proof}

\begin{lemma} A function terminates if all the recursive clauses of the
function definition participate in call cycles that shape shift the input value
towards a terminal clause of the function definition after each iteration.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}


If the value is decreased, the shape distortion need not be withkept since the
shape information that is deducible from here is by no means useful for call
cycle analysis, only size decrease is.

\begin{lstlisting}
$c_0$: count x 0 := x
$c_1$: count x y.z := count (count 0.x y) z
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
f ((0.a).(0.b)).(0.(0.c)) := 
f a := f a.0
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{verbatim}
equal x y := n-equal (normalize x) (normalize y)
n-equal 0 _._ := 0
n-equal _._ := 0
n-equal 0 0 = 0.0
n-equal a.b c.d = and (n-equal a c) (n-equal b d)
\end{verbatim}

Let $A$ denote the set of values that $p_2$ can
match without regard to $p_1$, let $B$ denote the set of values that $p_1$ can
match, and let $C$ denote the set of values that $p_2$ can come to match if
$p_1$ failed. Since $p_1\curlyvee p_2$, then we know that $B\subset A$,
$C\subset A$, $B\cap C=\emptyset$ and $C=A-B$.



We say that a value "has" a shape and "it is of" a shape.
