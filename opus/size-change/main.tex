\chapter{Size-Change Termination}\label{section:size-change-termination}

The size-change termination analysis builds upon the idea of flow analysis of
programs. In general, flow analysis aims to answer the question, ``What can we
say about a given point in a program without regard to the execution path taken
to that point?''. A ``point'' in a computer program, is in this case a primitive
operation such as an assignment, a condition branch, etc.

The idea is then to construct a graph where such points are nodes, and the arcs
in between them represent a transfer of control between the primitive
operations, that would otherwise occur under the execution of the program.
Such a node may have variable in-degree and out-degree. For instance, a
condition branch would usually have two possible transfers of control depending
on the outcome of the condition. Hence, it serves useful to label arcs
depending on when they are taken.

Such graphs are referred to as \emph{control flow graphs}. With a control flow
graph at hand, various optimization algorithms can be devised to traverse the
graph and deduce certain properties, such as e.g.  reoccurring primitive
operations on otherwise static variables\cite{kildall}.

\section{The algorithm}

We define the size-change termination algorithm as follows:

\begin{definition}\label{definition:size-change-algorithm} Given a program $r$
and its corresponding size-change graph $G$, yield ``halts'' if all the call
cycles in $G$ are monotonically decreasing, and ``unknown''
otherwise.\end{definition}
