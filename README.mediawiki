My BSc project at DIKU.

It is instructive to first glance at the slides for the BSc project defence

You'll find the report in
[https://github.com/oleks/bachelor/tree/master/opus/output opus/output] and the
final (shaky) Haskell prototype in
[https://github.com/oleks/bachelor/tree/master/final-prototype final-prototype].
